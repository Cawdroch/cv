        <h1>Chris Cawdron</h1>
        <p><em>Aviation Engineer specialising in early Gas Turbine Engines</em></p>
        <p>I was born and educated in the Midlands and completed a craft apprenticeship with the Ministry of Defence
          at the Royal Aircraft Establishment Bedford as well as attaining a BTEC HNC in Aerospace Engineering. I was trained
          in both airframe and engine disciplines but started to specialise in engines early on in my career. I moved onto to work
          full time at <a href="https://www.cosworth.com/">Cosworth Engineering</a> in Northampton whilst maintaining my aviation
          experience as a part time volunteer with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scorpion163/">Classic Aviation Projects</a>. At
          Cosworth, I was initially building race and high performance road car engines and then went on to work as technical and
          design lead on engine assembly procedures, tooling and rigs. I then moved onto the design of testbed installations and
          associated test rigs, this all culminating in project managing the installation of brand new 'state of the art' test bed
          installations for both IC engines and electric motors with responsibility towards budget and timescale constraints. I
          left Cosworth (by then <a href="https://www.mahle-powertrain.com/">Mahle Powertrain</a>) in 2017 to re-engage with my
          original career as an Aircraft Engineer. I now support the vintage aviation community both in the UK and abroad and
          I specialise in defining and performing <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/">CAA</a> compliant Calendar
          Life Extension Programs on first and second generation Gas Turbine Engines.</p>
